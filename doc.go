/*
Package chimp is a simple input package (mice, tablets etc). Device support will
be added when there is a need for it. The initial purpose of the package is to
support drawing tablet input for a paint program.

Only Linux is supported at the moment but the Linux device events are converted
to another representation exported by this package in a platform independent
manner.

Supported devices:

	Wacom Bamboo 16FG 6x8 (Linux)
